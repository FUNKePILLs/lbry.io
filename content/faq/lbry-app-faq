Using LBRY is easy but sometimes you can run into bugs, here is a list of commonly asked questions and solutions.

### Content fails to stream or download, what can I do?

1. Check this useful page out. [Content fails to download](https://lbry.io/faq/unable-to-stream).

2. If it still isn't working, it's probably a bug and you should report it ASAP. [Report a bug](https://lbry.io/faq/support).

3. How to find the log files.
## Windows
1. Open File Explorer.
2. Type `%appdata%\lbrynet` (or `%localappdata%\lbry\lbrynet` if you originally installed v0.14 and up) into the address bar and click Enter.

## MacOS
1. Open Finder.
1. Click Go on top menu and choose "Go To Folder".
1. Type "~/Library/Application Support/LBRY" and then click go.

## Ubuntu / Linux *(Exact steps may differ slightly)* 
1. Navigate to your home directory. Ensure hidden files and folders are shown if using a graphical file explorer.
2. Navigate to the .lbrynet folder (or `.local/share/lbry/lbrynet` if you originally installed v0.14 and up).

4. The most helpful place for LBRY bugs. [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/U5aRyN6).
Go to #help.

5. [Github Issues](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry.io/issues) page where you can query for the topic you want to submit. 

### Downloads / Streams slow?

Since LBRY is a peer to peer protocol, download times will be dependent upon how many hosts have the file and your connection to those hosts. As the network grows, more hosts will have the file available so that the download speeds will improve.

There are still some improvements we can make on the protocol level to speed up the node discovery process and ensure the node is connecting to best available peers. 

### Downloads glitchy / incomplete?

1. Quit the LBRY app.
2. Delete the local files (files downloaded from LBRY).
3. Restart the LBRY app.
4. Redownload the files.
5. If still not working, see above topics.

### What is the purpose of having my email connected to LBRY?

We need it for login purposes and you can backup your wallet through your email address.

### What information is tied to the account?

Only your basic profile information such as names and such are tied to the account. 
You'll be sent LBRY updates, security issues, and great new content.
We'll never sell your email and you can unsubscribe at any time.

### What is a wallet and how do I find it?

A wallet is a secure, digital wallet used to store, send and recieve cryptocurrency like LBRY credits.
The LBRY app comes with it's own wallet, so you can get going right away!

The LBRY app is also integrated with [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.io/#/coins): The easiest way to exchange cryptocurrencies.

Your wallet generates addresses which you give to people, in order to recieve LBC, and you use others' wallet addresses to send them LBC.

[Trade LBC now](https://lbry.io/faq/exchanges).

In the app, you can find your wallet in the top-right hand corner, as the little bank symbol.

### Where do I find my LBC address?

You can find your addresses by clicking on the bank icon first, then clicking on the Send/Recieve tab.

### Change email associated with LBRY
**Note : You can only be logged into a single LBRY account at a time with a single Windows user. To sign out and switch LBRY accounts, see [this](https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-change-email).**

### Backup information for wallet

Do what all the cool kids are doing and backup your wallet. Better safe than sorry!

Click on the bank icon near the top-right.

You'll be greeted with the following page. Follow the instrucions to the letter to avoid errors.

Just copy the file the app specifies over to another folder or another device, and you're good to go.
Make sure to place the file in a new device where it was stored on the old device.
E.g. Old device : root/desktop/lbry/lbryum
     New device : root/install_location/lbry/lbryum

See? Simple.

**Note: You need to backup your wallet before you switch over to a new device. Also, only your wallet transactions are stored. When moving over to a new pc, moving the wallet is only part of the equation - If you want your LBRY file data (Downloads area in app) and physical downloads, see the following topic. **

### Migrating LBRY app data (Downloads from LBRY)

Only backing up your wallet will only take care of the transactions. To move over the downloaded files as well, [backup your LBRY app data](https://lbry.io/faq/backup-data).

### Why is content downloaded to my PC?

LBRY is a new decentralized protocol, meaning there are no big servers storing all the files (like YouTube). LBRY works more like a peer-to-peer file sharing technology. ( Kinda like Bittorrent, for all you pirates! Arrgh! ) 

Essentially, it means that you have to upload stuff, and wait for it to 'seed', or let others download it. The more your file has been downloaded, the higher chance of it being available and faster to download. 

When you stream, for example, a video, LBRY will download the video and continually seed it, uploading bits of it for others to use. This is what is called a peer. Lots of peers form the technology, allowing for files to be shared easily. You fulfill the need of a server, and this is the advantage of 'decentralization'.

### How do I know if I'm sharing content properly?

Since LBRY will continually 'seed' your uploads so others can download it, you can [ask others](https://discordapp.com/invite/U5aRyN6) to check if your files are being uploaded normally. You can also check your Published page for more details on your uploads.
