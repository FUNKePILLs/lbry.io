The LBRY App allows you to view free and paid content, upload your digital media for free or a set price, tip your favorite creators, send/receive LBRY Credits(LBC) and earn credits through LBRY Rewards. The purpose of this FAQ is to answer questions about the basic functionalies available in the LBRY app. 

### What is the purpose of having my email connected to LBRY?

A LBRY email is collected to [identify](https://lbry.io/faq/identity-requirements) you in order to be eligible for [LBRY Rewards](#rewards) and to stay up to date on the latest LBRY news. All other data, including your [wallet](#wallet), [downloads](#download) or published content is stored locally on your computer. 

### What if I want to run LBRY on multiple computers?
If you want to run the LBRY app on multiple PCs, you can either choose not to sign in on the other computers or use a different email address. These additional accounts will not be eligible for LBRY rewards as they are only allowed on a 1 account per household basis. Redeeming rewards on multiple computers may lead to Rewards being disabled on all accounts.  

### What are LBRY Rewards? {#rewards}

[LBRY Rewards](https://lbry.io/faq/rewards) are used to distribute LBRY Credits(LBC) to new and existing users by allowing them to explore the app and completing tasks that generate LBC as rewards. In order to be eligible for Rewards, you need to [verify your identity](https://lbry.io/faq/identity-requirements) in order to uniquely identify you as a LBRY user. Strict Rewards abuse policies are in effect. 

### What is a wallet and how do I find it? {#wallet}

A wallet is a secure, digital wallet used to store, send and recieve cryptocurrency like LBRY Credits(LBC). The LBRY App comes with it's own wallet and is stored locally on your computer and nowhere else! **It is critical that you [backup your wallet data](https://lbry.io/faq/backup) in case you lose access to your PC or need to [migrate](https://lbry.io/faq/backup-data) to a new one.**

In the app, you can find your wallet in the top-right hand corner, next to the bank icon.  
[Find wallet](https://spee.ch/6f82ff233910eebeb0f32f69710bd98c6a6bcb2a/walletaccess.png)

Your wallet generates addresses which you give to people, in order to recieve LBC, and you use others' wallet addresses to send them LBC. Both of these functions are performed in the Send/Receive tab of the wallet.

The LBRY app is also integrated with [Shapeshift](https://lbry.io/faq/shapeshift) which allows you to convert cryptocurrencies into LBC or you can [trade for LBC on exchanges](https://lbry.io/faq/exchanges).

### Where do I find my LBC wallet address?

You can find your addresses by clicking on the bank icon first, then clicking on the Send/Recieve tab.

### Where is all my data stored? {#data}
Please see the [LBRY directories](https://lbry.io/faq/lbry-directories) FAQ page for more information on where LBRY data is stored. 

### Why is content downloaded to my PC? {#download}

LBRY is a decentralized peer to peer protocol, meaning there are no big servers storing all the files (like YouTube), but instead, data is stored on each participant's computer (similar too BitTorrent). When you stream or download, LBRY will store the content in encrypted chunks called [blobs files](https://lbry.io/faq/lbry-directories) and seed it to  the entire network so others can also download from you. Currently there is no way to stop sharing or store data temporarily, but you can always delete any files you don't want to seed from the LBRY app Downloads area. 

### How do I know if I'm sharing content with the LBRY network properly?

Easiest way to check if you are sharing correctly is to determine if the port used for seeding, 3333, is open to the rest of the LBRY network.  To do so, type 3333 into [this port checking tool](http://www.canyouseeme.org) and see the result. It if shows Open, you are all set. If it shows closed, you may need to check your router settings for uPNP options or port forwad 3333 TCP and 4444 UDP to your local computer running LBRY. Firewall and NAT settings may also affect the availability of this port. 

### Content fails to stream or download, what can I do?
Please see our [streaming guide](https://lbry.io/faq/unable-to-stream) if you consistently cannot download or stream content on LBRY.

### Change email associated with LBRY
If you ever need to change your LBRY email address or sign out, please see [this guide](https://lbry.io/faq/how-to-change-email). If you sign into a new email and need to tranfer your Verification status, you'll need to [reach out to us](mailto:help@lbryio) in order to link your accounts. Please do not verify again to gain rewards again, your Rewards account may be disabled for abuse.
